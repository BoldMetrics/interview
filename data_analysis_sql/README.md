Welcome to **Spacesuit & Co.**, the hottest Space Suit fashion brand outfitting astronauts since 2022! 
Our suits are highest-end, super air-tight variety, and are very expensive 🚀 🧑‍🚀 💸

We need to learn more about our astronaut customers, who are very picky when it comes to space suit fit. The better we understand their behaviour, the better we can do to fit them in the right space suit.

In the `/data` folder you will find data in `csv` format gathered by the frontend application that provides our astronaut customers with space suit recommendations. The data from the `telemetry` table describes how users interacted with our application. The `orders` table contains purchases and returns data for those same users.


### The task

Please load the data into a database (feel free to make use of the scripts located in `/data/ddl` to create target tables) and use SQL to analyse it and answer the questions below. Please consider the pointers from the **Deliverables** section when structuring your work.

1. How many space suits were sold?

2. What is the average age for astronauts who purchased and astronauts who returned their items?

3. For the product with the most purchases, which size was returned the most? How many times was that size returned?

4. For the product with the most purchases, what was the return rate for astronauts who closed the application?



### Deliverables

1. **Spacesuit & Co.** is a distributed team working in different timezones. Therefore, we ask you to structure your findings and code in a way that other analysts could pick it up intuitively and continue building up on top of it.

2. Please submit your findings and code through a pull request that the rest of the **Spacesuit & Co.** team could review.
