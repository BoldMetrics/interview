# Overview

Welcome to <em>Spacesuit & Co.</em>, the hottest Space Suit fashion brand outfitting astronauts since 2022! 
Our suits are of the high-end, super air-tight variety, and are very expensive 🚀 🧑‍🚀 💸

We need to learn more about our astronaut customers who are pretty picky when it comes to spacesuit fit. The better we understand their behavior, the better we can fit them in the right spacesuit.

This directory contains two files with data in CSV format. Each CSV contains one table:
* `data/csv/purchase_return.csv`<br>
The `purchase_return` table contains purchase orders and return data for users that have made a purchase Spacesuit & Co. purchase.
* `data/csv/user_telemetry.csv`<br>
The `user_telemetry` table contains usage data from our application.
