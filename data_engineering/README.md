Welcome to <em>Spacesuit & Co.</em>, the hottest Space Suit fashion brand outfitting astronauts since 2022! 
Our suits are highest-end, super air-tight variety, and are very expensive 🚀 🧑‍🚀 💸

We need to learn more about our astronaut customers who are pretty picky when it comes to spacesuit fit. The better we understand their behavior, the better we can fit them in the right spacesuit.

You'll two files with data in csv format in this directory which contains two tables, described below:

The `purchase_return` table contains purchase orders and return data for users that have made a purchase Spacesuit & Co. purchase.
The `user_telemetry` table contains usage data from our application.

### Assignment

You're a Data Engineer at Bold Metrics. We have received the `purchase_return.csv` and `user_telemetry.csv` raw data in excel and it must be ingested into our data warehouse so that our Data Analysts can perform analysis and create reports.

_This is a 'walk-through' assignment. Please take us through your actions, thoughts and assumptions as you answer the questions below. This task is designed for you to show us how you work with and approach (raw) data, while simultaneously for us to get an understanding of your interpretation of the data as well as your handling of a raw data set. Throughout the SQL tasks, make sure to mention any potential limitations or other things that stand out in the data that you think could be relevant._

Feel free to ask us questions if anything is unclear ;) Good luck!

Please use SQL for the following questions:

    1. How many space suits where sold?
    2. Find the average age both for astronauts who purchased and kept their items and astronauts who returned.
    3. For the product with the most purchases, which size was returned the most? How many times was that size returned?
