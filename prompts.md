Often, something doesn't work during an integration due to CSS on our clients' sites. Occassionally, we'll add a CSS rule to override theirs to fix the issue, and sometimes, we'll ask the client to make some updates. How would you respond to this email?

2. Occasionally we'll get emails that show frustration with either bugs or predictions. Aya writes:

_"I'm still getting the wrong size. To make matters worse this was based on my measurements (my collar size is wrong too)."_

Often, we'll get on calls with clients to explain how our predictions work, or if simple enough, we'll respond via email. Issues like this one are often due to fit preference and people expecting our predictions to match their clothing preferences (some like clothes baggy, some like them tight).  How would you respond to this email?

3. Vivian writes: _"I'm trying to get a prediction using the API, but I'm getting an error. It's telling me by sleeve is too long, but I'm putting in 25"! What's going on?"_
