One of our coworkers asked us to set up this site to create a website with different descriptions of body measurements. On the left should be a nav bar with different body measurements. On the right should be an image and description of that measurement.

I've accidentally pushed and merged the website, but there's a bug. Find the bug, fix it and create a new pr with the fix and in the comment create a short description of the bug and what you did to fix it.

The only code you need to focus on is in the components folder.
