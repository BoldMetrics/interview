Using Javascript & React, please build a kanban board, an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work. Using state, you should be able to create a ticket, delete tickets, and move tickets in between swim lanes. We've created a simple form, and three swim lanes named Ready, In Progress and Completed. More explicit instructions are below.

1. You need to add functionality to the form we've built in order to create a ticket. Tickets should be created in the "Ready" swim lane.

2. Each ticket should have a name, a description, buttons to move back and forth between swim lanes, and a delete button. We have provided an example task to give you an idea of what each task should look like.

3. Allow each ticket to move between swimlanes. We have created arrow buttons within the ticket. Create functionality so that those buttons allows the ticket to move between swim lanes. For instance, a ticket should be able to move from the "Ready" swim lane to the "In Progress" swim lane.

4. Each ticket should be able to be deleted in any swim lane. In the example ticket we've provided a "Delete" button. Please create the functionality in order to delete a ticket.

5. We have added a few styled components in App.js. Feel free to make changes to those components or create styled components of your own as you would like.

6. There is no requirement to persist these tickets in a database. You can simply use State to show tasks.
