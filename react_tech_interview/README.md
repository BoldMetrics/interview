Using Javascript & React, please build a kanban board, an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work. This project should meet the following requirements:

1. The kanban board has 3 swimlanes named Ready, In Progress and Completed.

2. There is functionality to add a ticket using the form that we've created. Once created, the tickets should appear under the "Ready" swimlane.

3. Each ticket should have a name, a description, buttons to move back and forth between swim lanes, and a delete button that removes the ticket.

4. Allow each ticket to move between swimlanes.

5. There are styled components available to you to complete this task in App.js. If you prefer to use another system, feel free.

6. There is no requirement to persist these tickets in a database.
